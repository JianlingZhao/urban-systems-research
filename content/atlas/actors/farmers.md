# Farmers

Farmers are central decision-making actors in the system.
They are not defined by a single mode of production or sale, but by their ability to choose between multiple pathways under conditions of uncertainty.

## Role in the system
Farmers determine how land, labour, and produce are mobilised. They decide whether to retain production control, seek intermediaries, cooperate with others, or exit production by leasing out land.

## Practices
- Independent production and direct sales
- Selling through vegetable agents
- Participating in cooperative or collective arrangements
- Leasing out land to operators or bases
- Switching between practices across seasons or years

## Exposure to risk
Farmers are directly exposed to price volatility, market access uncertainty, and trust-related risk. Many decisions prioritise stability and predictability over maximising short-term returns.

## Relation to other actors
Farmers interact with agents, land operators, project organisations, and markets. Their choices shape the structure of the wider system rather than following a single dominant pathway.
