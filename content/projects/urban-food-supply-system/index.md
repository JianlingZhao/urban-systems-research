# Urban Food Supply System

## Overview
This project investigates how urban vegetable supply systems are practically organised under conditions of price volatility, information delay, and weak formal contracting. Rather than approaching the system as a stable supply chain, the research treats it as a dynamic configuration of people, platforms, materials, and sites that are continuously coordinated through everyday practices.

The project developed from field-oriented research combining market visits, informal conversations, platform observation, and the synthesis of fragmented records. Its aim is not to offer a single explanatory model, but to make visible how decisions, risks, and responsibilities are negotiated across different actors within the system.

## Research focus
The research focuses on three interconnected questions:
- How are prices, quality, and sales decisions formed in everyday market situations where information is incomplete and constantly changing?
- What roles do intermediary actors play in coordinating production, circulation, and sales under these conditions?
- How do digital platforms participate in shaping visibility, trust, and access thin the system?

## Approach and scope
This study adopts a field-oriented, systems-based perspective. It does not aim to produce a long-term ethnography of a single group, but instead traces interactions cross multiple sites, including production areas, wholesale markets, and online platforms.

Materials include:
- Field conversations with farmers, intermediaries, and traders
- Observations from wholesale markets and collection sites
- Analysis of short-video platforms and agricultural trading platforms
- Iterative system mapping to identify recurring roles, practices, and flows

The focus is on identifying how coordination is achieved in practice, rather than on evaluating normative policy solutions.

## What this project examines
Across the project, attention is given to:
- Farmers’ production and selling decisions under market uncertainty
- Intermediary roles, particularly vegetable agents, as coordinators of information, logistics, and risk
- Wholesale markets as sites of price discovery and negotiation
- Digital platforms as infrastructures for connection, self-presentation, and transaction initiation
- The connections between upstream production decisions and downstream demand

## How to read this project
This project can be explored in different ways:
- As a narrative: follow the story sections from the system overview to specific components and their connections
- By system elements: browse the system atlas to explore roles, mechanisms, and sites
- By research focus: focus on specific chapters such as intermediation or platform-based coordination

- ## Status and next steps
This project is ongoing. Future work will extend the analysis and explore possibilities for data-driven modelling of information flows within the system.
