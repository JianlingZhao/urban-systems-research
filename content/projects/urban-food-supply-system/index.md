# Urban Food Supply System

## Overview
This project investigates how urban food supply systems are practically organised under conditions of price volatility, information delay, and weak formal contracting. Rather than approaching the system as a stable supply chain, the research treats it as a dynamic configuration of people, platforms, materials, and sites that are continuously coordinated through everyday practices.

The project developed from field-oriented research combining market visits, informal conversations, platform observation, and the synthesis of fragmented records. Its aim is not to offer a single explanatory model, but to make visible how decisions, risks, and responsibilities are negotiated across different actors within the system, from production and circulation to consumption.

## Research focus
The research focuses on three interconnected questions:
- How are prices, quality, and sales decisions formed in everyday market situations where information is incomplete and constantly changing?
- What roles do intermediary actors and organisational arrangements play in coordinating production, circulation, and sales under these conditions?
- How do digital platforms, narratives, and consumption practices participate in shaping visibility, trust, and access within the system?

## Approach and scope
This study adopts a field-oriented, systems-based perspective. It does not aim to produce a long-term ethnography of a single group, but instead traces interactions across multiple sites, including rural production areas, urban agricultural projects, wholesale markets, and online platforms.

Materials include:
- Field conversations with farmers, intermediaries, project organisers, and traders
- Observations from wholesale markets, collection sites, and urban agricultural spaces
- Analysis of short-video platforms, agricultural trading platforms, and project communication channels
- Iterative system mapping to identify recurring roles, practices, and flows across production, circulation, and consumption

The focus is on identifying how coordination is achieved in practice, rather than on evaluating normative policy or design solutions.

## What this project examines
Across the project, attention is given to:
- Farmers’ production and selling decisions under market uncertainty
- Different forms of intermediation, including market-based vegetable agents and project-based organisational actors
- Wholesale markets and distribution nodes as sites of price discovery and negotiation
- Digital platforms as infrastructures for connection, self-presentation, and transaction initiation
- Urban agricultural initiatives and consumption-oriented projects as alternative coordination mechanisms linking production and demand
- The ways in which consumer engagement, seasonal menus, and participatory activities feed back into production and organisational decisions

## How to read this project
This project can be explored in different ways:
- **As a narrative:** follow the story sections from a system overview to specific components and their connections, including different forms of intermediation and coordination.
- **By system elements:** browse the system atlas to explore roles, mechanisms, and sites that recur across rural and urban contexts.
- **By research focus:** focus on specific thematic chapters such as intermediation, platform-based coordination, or consumption feedback.

These perspectives are intended to be complementary, allowing the system to be understood both as an interconnected whole and through specific practices and roles.

## Status and next steps
This project is ongoing. Future work will extend the analysis of consumer-facing segments and urban agricultural initiatives, and explore possibilities for data-supported modelling of information flows and coordination mechanisms within the system.
