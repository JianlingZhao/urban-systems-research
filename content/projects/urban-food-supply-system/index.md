# Urban Food Supply System

## Overview
This project examines how urban vegetable supply systems operate under conditions of price volatility, information asymmetry, and weak formal contracting. Rather than treating the system as a linear supply chain, the research approaches it as a socio-technical system shaped by everyday coordination practices, information flows, and informal mediation.

The project was developed as a field-oriented research case that combines document analysis, platform observation, and targeted field conversations. It aims to make visible the mechanisms through which agricultural products move from production sites to urban markets, and how decisions are made across different parts of the system.
