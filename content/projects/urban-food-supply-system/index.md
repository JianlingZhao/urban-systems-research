# Urban Food Supply System

## Overview
This project examines how urban food supply systems (specifically vegetables) operate under conditions of price volatility, information asymmetry, and weak formal contracting. Rather than treating the system as a linear supply chain, the research approaches it as a socio-technical system shaped by everyday coordination practices, information flows, and informal mediation.

The project was developed as a field-oriented research case that combines document analysis, platform observation, and targeted field conversations. It aims to make visible the mechanisms through which agricultural products move from production sites to urban markets, and how decisions are made across different parts of the system.


## Research questions
The project is guided by the following questions:
- How do urban vegetable supply systems function in practice beyond formal supply-chain models?
- How are prices, risks, and production decisions coordinated under volatile market conditions?
- What roles do intermediary actors play in connecting production, mediation, and consumption?

## Approach and methods
This research adopts a field-oriented and systems-based approach rather than a single-site ethnographic method. The study combines:
- Desk research and policy documents
- Analysis of online platforms used by market participants
- Targeted field conversations with farmers, intermediaries, and traders
- Synthesis of existing datasets with field observations

The focus is on identifying recurring practices and coordination mechanisms across sites, rather than producing long-term ethnographic accounts of a single community.

## What this project examines
The project explores the urban food supply system across multiple layers:
- The production end, where farmers make planting and harvesting decisions under uncertainty
- Informal intermediary roles, particularly vegetable agents, who coordinate information, pricing, and logistics
- Wholesale and market environments where prices are negotiated
- Downstream demand signals and their feedback into production decisions
- Digital platforms as infrastructures for information circulation and credibility-building

## How to read this project
This project can be explored in different ways:
- As a narrative: follow the story sections from the system overview to specific components and their connections
- By system elements: browse the system atlas to explore roles, mechanisms, and sites
- By research focus: focus on specific chapters such as intermediation or platform-based coordination

- ## Status and next steps
This project is ongoing. Future work will extend the analysis and explore possibilities for data-driven modelling of information flows within the system.
